<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>
  Implemented this simple version of MS Paint to undestand the Java Event Model and Java AWT.
  Scrible makes use of mouse event and GUI Components such as Canvas, Radio Button and CheckBox.
  Whenever a mouse drag event is registered, the size of object under operation is increased i.e. It is transformed.
  When a Mouse release event ccurs, the object under operation is added to the list of Canvas Objects.
